## Usage Guide

### For Farmers:
1. Register as a farmer with farm details
2. Add products with images and pricing
3. Manage inventory and orders
4. Update order status and communicate with clients

### For Clients:
1. Register as a client
2. Browse products by category or search
3. Place orders with desired quantities
4. **Cancel orders if needed** (pending status only)
5. Track order progress

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **CSS not loading**: Tailwind CDN is configured in index.html
2. **MongoDB connection**: Check connection string in .env
3. **Port conflicts**: Backend uses 5000, frontend uses 3000
4. **Order cancellation**: Only pending orders can be cancelled

### Performance Optimizations:
- Pagination for product listings
- Debounced search functionality
- Optimized database queries
- Image compression for uploads
